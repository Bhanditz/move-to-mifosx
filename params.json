You can obtain a JRE for free from http://java.sun.com/.\r\n\r\n##  Installation\r\nPDI does not require installation. Simply unpack the zip file into a folder of your choice. On Unix-like operating systems, you will need to make the shell scripts executable by using the chmod command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd Kettle\r\nchmod +x *.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n##  Spoon Introduction\r\nSpoon is the graphical tool with which you design and test every PDI process. The other PDI components execute the processes designed with Spoon, and are executed from a terminal window.\r\n\r\n## Starting Spoon\r\nStart Spoon by executing spoon.bat on Windows, or spoon.sh on Unix-like operating systems. As soon as Spoon starts, a dialog window appears asking for the repository connection data. Click the No Repository button.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
