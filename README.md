Move To Mifosx
==============

A migration tool to migrate data from Mifos 2.x to MifosX

Installing Kettle
You can download Pentaho Data Integration (PDI), also known as Kettle, from Sourceforge.net. Go to http://www.pentaho.com/download/ if you are looking for Pentaho Enterprise Edition (EE) of PDI.

Prerequisites
Kettle requires the Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.5 (also called 5.0 in some naming schemes) or newer. You can obtain a JRE for free from http://java.sun.com/.

Installation
PDI does not require installation. Simply unpack the zip file into a folder of your choice. On Unix-like operating systems, you will need to make the shell scripts executable by using the chmod command:

cd Kettle
chmod +x *.sh
Spoon Introduction
Spoon is the graphical tool with which you design and test every PDI process. The other PDI components execute the processes designed with Spoon, and are executed from a terminal window.

Starting Spoon
Start Spoon by executing spoon.bat on Windows, or spoon.sh on Unix-like operating systems. As soon as Spoon starts, a dialog window appears asking for the repository connection data. Click the No Repository button.
